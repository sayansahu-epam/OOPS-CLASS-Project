# Hyundai Cars Company – OOP Implementation (Python)

This project is a Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation of a car manufacturing company, modeled around Hyundai.  
It focuses on applying core OOP concepts using a real-world structure.

---

## Overview

The project models a car company hierarchy where:
- A generic abstract company defines required behaviors
- Hyundai implements the company logic
- Car categories such as SUV, Sedan, and Hatchback extend the brand
- Specific car models like Creta, Verna, and Grand i10 inherit from categories

The design is kept simple and readable while following proper OOP practices.

## OOP Concepts Used

- Abstraction using an abstract base class
- Inheritance (multilevel and hierarchical)
- Polymorphism through method overriding
- Encapsulation using private attributes and properties

---

## Car Models Included

- **Creta** (SUV)
- **Verna** (Sedan)
- **Grand i10** (Hatchback)

Each model contains its own features, mileage, and pricing logic.
